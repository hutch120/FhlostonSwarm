# FhlostonSwarm

## CLI

Requires Node 20+ and [AWS CLI v2](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

```
npm install
npm link        # one-time: puts `swarm` on your PATH
swarm login
```

`swarm login` configures an AWS CLI profile named `swarm` (account `885922397779`, region `ap-southeast-2`), signs in through the browser with your AWS console credentials (`aws login`, no IAM Identity Center needed), and verifies the identity. Use `--remote` on a machine without a browser. Afterwards use `--profile swarm` or `AWS_PROFILE=swarm`.

If the account later uses IAM Identity Center, run `swarm login --sso --start-url https://d-xxxxxxxxxx.awsapps.com/start` (start URL and role are saved to the profile; or set `SWARM_SSO_START_URL` / `SWARM_SSO_ROLE`).
